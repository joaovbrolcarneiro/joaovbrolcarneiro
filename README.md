# Hi, I'm Joao 👋

I'm a student at **42 Porto** and software developer at **Indelible Prophecy**, passionate about **C programming** and **Artificial Intelligence**. I have a degree in **Psychology**, but my love for problem-solving and coding led me to the world of programming.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on improving my algorithms and C projects.
- 🌱 I’m always learning about AI and how it intersects with other programming languages.
- 🤝 I love helping coders and being active in the coding community.
- 💼 Seeking opportunities to collaborate on open-source projects and AI-driven technologies.
